## Hi, I am Zhuoheng Li ðŸ‘‹

I work in an intersection of AI, robotics, and space exploration. I build systems for you ãƒ¾(^â–½^*)) so feel free to ask me if you have any question!

- âš¡ Recent works: Train a generalized policy / video generation model for robotics manipulation.
    -  [GR1-Training](https://github.com/EDiRobotics/GR1-Training) is the current SOTA policy on CALVIN benchmark for multi-task robotics manipulation (ABC-D split).
    -  [MimicTest](https://github.com/EDiRobotics/mimictest) integrates some of my policies, including Florence Policy developed on Microsoft's Florence2 VLM, which is trained with VQA, OCR, detection and segmentation tasks on 900M images.
        - Unlike OpenVLA and RT2, Florence2 is much smaller with 0.23B (Florence-2-base) or 0.7B (Florence-2-large) parameters.
        - Florence policy directly generates continuous actions with a linear action head / a diffusion transformer action head.
    - I am contributing to the HuggingFace [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) toolbox, including integration of the Florence policy.
    - I am participating the [1x challenge](https://github.com/1x-technologies/1xgpt) to train video generation model for robotics manipulation.
    - I developed some VLM ranged from 2B~8B, please check [My HuggingFace Page](https://huggingface.co/StarCycle).
